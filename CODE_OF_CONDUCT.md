# Code of Conduct

All interactions with this project, as with any facet of our community, must follow our core values:

1. Competence.
- If you say you are going to do something, do it, or acknowledge that it was not done.
- No finessing/ pretending to forget what the assignment was
- This means arguing up front or as soon as the “doer” knows about whether/ how / when it’s doable. Up front, the “asker” needs to set the timeline and quality level. She has an obligation to listen to the “doer” if the doer asks for clarity.  
- “We stick to our word”- Guillermo
2. Excellence. 
- Solve for Quality
- Bring your best to what you do. 
  - “Don’t half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing” ~ Ron Swanson
- Examples
  - Product 1 - Health Checks 
  - Product 2 - Chrome Extension UX/ UI
  - Team
- BUT ALSO, IN CONFLICT...
3. Scrappiness. 
- Solve for Quality AND Speed
- Rough drafts are very very very good.
- It saves us all time in the long term
- Never work on something new to you for more than 3 hours without getting feedback (really)
  - Ask how long something should take for the next version/ due by when
  - What does the first draft look like?
- I have never said, “I wish this were better”
- I frequently say “I wish you had shown me a draft so I could have saved you time”
- What is a “draft”
  - A conversation!
  - Sketch on a paper
  - Rows and columns on a spreadsheet
  - Titles of a powerpoint presentation
  - Random bullet points
4. Growth.
- Everyone at Sema is curious- we hire people who want to learn
- Preferred to say you don’t know than pretend otherwise
  - “If you have a problem, raise a flag” and have someone help you-- Ilya K.
- Share “bad news” quickly (unlikely, but important!)
  - System outages (“time sensitive”)
  - Always share potential bugs- even if you’re not sure
  - A problem in the code

- Yes Sema: paired programming [shared ownership, too]
  - Or paired QA
  - Paired Health Checking
  - Or paired anything
  - Rubber-ducking
  - Mirroring
- Bonus points for telling Matt he’s maybe/ probably/ definitely wrong
5. Ownership.
  - The project is yours- make sure it happens
  - We all have overdeveloped  sense of responsibility
  - Not Sema: not my problem
  - Yes Sema: I will fix it
  - Yes Sema: can I look at [the other part of the business]?
  - Yes Sema: I could help but I bet someone else could do it better
  - Yes: follow through with your responsibilities and accountabilities
  - Yes: Keep track of requests E2E
- AND
  - Act like you are the CEO of the company- what’s the right answer in this situation- 
    - what best serves Sema in this moment
    - What best improves code quality in the world in this moment
